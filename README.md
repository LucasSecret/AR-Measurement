# How to use it ?

Click the menu button <img src="https://github.com/LucasSecret/AR-Measurement/blob/master/Assets/Images/icons8-menu-48.png" width="25" height="25"> to show the shapes list and select the shape you want to draw.

Wait for ARCore to detect planes, and then aim it with the reticule placed in the middle of the screen. Then click on the vertex button    <img src="https://github.com/LucasSecret/AR-Measurement/blob/master/Assets/Images/favpng_bullseye-shooting-target-font-awesome-clip-art.png" width="25" height="25">    to place a vertex on the plane. 

For circles, squares and boxes, you just have to place 2 points.

For triangles, you have to place 3 points.

And for lines and polygons, you can place as many points as you want. But to end the shape, you must hit the validate button      <img src="https://github.com/LucasSecret/AR-Measurement/blob/master/Assets/Images/icons8-checkmark-96.png" width="25" height="25">

Finally, if you hover an existing vertex, you can move it by holding the moving button   <img src="https://github.com/LucasSecret/AR-Measurement/blob/master/Assets/Images/icons8-hand-50.png" width="25" height="25">  or delete it by hitting the trash button     <img src="https://github.com/LucasSecret/AR-Measurement/blob/master/Assets/Images/icons8-delete-64.png" width="25" height="25">



# Enjoy !
